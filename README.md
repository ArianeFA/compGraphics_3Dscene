# compGraphics_3Dscene
#How do I approach designing software? 

  This project taught me every problem can be broken into smaller and less intimidating parts. For this project, I tried to work on each object separately. After I had developed all the elements from my scene, I joined them into the same unit. This tactic can help me in various ways in my future career. For example, before releasing a program that I developed, I would separate my code into small units and test them individually. This would guarantee me that the backbone of my code works.

#How do I approach developing programs? 

  Divide and conquer was my strategy throughout the course. I tried to use one buffer/array/mesh for each element on my 3D scene. This way if something wasn’t working I could pinpoint where the problem was coming from. After each iteration, my project got closer and closer to my chosen 3D scene. This process helped me develop my work since I knew that every week I had a working project to build from. After each milestone was completed I gained the confidence to keep improving my scene. I knew that my instructor had verified my work so all I needed to do was improve on it.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

  Computational graphics and visualizations introduced me to C++ coding language. This knowledge will give me a better idea of how C++ works, which will help me in future classes that require this coding language. This class also taught me how rendering works, and how the computer processes code into image. Even though I don’t intend to follow a computational graphics career, this knowledge can give me an edge over my future colleagues.
